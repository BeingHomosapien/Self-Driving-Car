As Shown in the image above this car utilises three distance sensors (Unity Ray Objects). These three distances are inputted in a neural network that is made from scratch and the values of acceleratoin and turn are ouputted.

The Neural Network itself is a linear neural network.
The network optimizes with the help of Genetic Algorithm instead of relying on BackPropagation.
